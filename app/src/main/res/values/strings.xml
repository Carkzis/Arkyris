    <string name="article_text">Well, this is could be an interesting one. After learning
    some <b>Python</b> (a great programming language, by the way) and using it in a variety of
    diffferent ways, such as in the form of web apps, GUI manipulation and even some very
    basic machine learning (although I have to say backpropagation prompted me to put
    a pin in <i>that</i>, at least for the time being), I decided to go on a make an app for
    Android. Okay, so it\'s <b>Java</b>, not Python, and sure, I would like to learn some
    Kotlin along the way, but anyhoo, here\'s to my next slightly larger project of creating
    an app that can act as a sort of diary of colours, where you can describe each day
    as the colour you are currently feeling. There will also be a public screen, that will
    show a collective colour diary for all the users. Yes… users… may even get some Python
    in there with a <b>Django REST</b> back-end! Anyway, check out my GitHub at \n
